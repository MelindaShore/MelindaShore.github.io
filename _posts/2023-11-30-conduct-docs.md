title: IETF Codes of conduct
---

This is an attempt to corral various IETF policy statements
and documents on conduct into one location, to help
get a handle on what's out there.  There are some policies under discussion as of this writing (for example, mailing list moderation and an IRTF Code of Conduct), and not everything included here is normative.

- [BCP 54/RFC 7154](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc7154.html) is the 
IETF consensus document providing guidelines for IETF
participant conduct.

- [IETF Anti-Harassment Policy](https://www7.ietf.org/about/groups/iesg/statements/anti-harassment-policy/).  This is
an IESG statement putting forth an anti-harassment policy.
It may be worth checking to verify that it's consistent with
both RFC 7154 and RFC 7776, both of which are more recent.

- [IETF Note Well](https://www.ietf.org/about/note-well/)

- [IETF Anti-Harassment Procedures - BCP 25/RFC 7776](https://www.ietf.org/about/note-well/)

- [IRTF Code of Conduct](https://www.ietf.org/archive/id/draft-perkins-irtf-code-of-conduct-00.html).  This document
is currently in draft form and has not yet been published,
but is here for completeness.  

- [IETF Community Moderation](https://www.ietf.org/id/draft-ecahc-moderation-00.html) is a first crack at a
revised mailing list moderation policy/process, and is
quite early in its discussion.

- [IESG Statement on Inclusive Language](https://www.ietf.org/about/groups/iesg/statements/on-inclusive-language/)

- [IESG Statement on Internet-Draft Authorship](https://www.ietf.org/about/groups/iesg/statements/internet-draft-authorship/) covers those cases where someone has been added as an author on a draft without their knowledge or consent.

- [IESG Statement on Oppressive or Exclusionary Language](https://www.ietf.org/about/groups/iesg/statements/statement-on-oppressive-exclusionary-language/) is not really a 
policy, per se.

- [IESG Meeting Photography Policy](https://www.ietf.org/about/groups/iesg/statements/meeting-photography-policy/) makes it 
clear that the wishes of those who don't want to be photographed
must be respected.

- [IESG Advice for WG Chairs Dealing with Off-Topic Posting](https://www.ietf.org/about/groups/iesg/statements/off-topic-postings/).

- [IESG Statement on Disruptive Posting](https://www.ietf.org/about/groups/iesg/statements/disruptive-posting/)

- [An IETF With Much Diversity and Professional Conduct](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc7704).  This document is
not a BCP, nor is it normative (was it published as an
individual contribution?) but provides some background, as
well as some expectations of IETF participants.

- [IETF LLC Code of Conduct](https://www.ietf.org/about/administration/policies-procedures/code-of-conduct/) covers
LLC contractors and employees.  It does _not_ cover most IETF
participants (participants, chairs, IESG and IAB members, etc) but is included here for completeness.
