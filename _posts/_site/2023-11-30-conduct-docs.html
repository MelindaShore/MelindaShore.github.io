<p>This is an attempt to corral various IETF policy statements
and documents on conduct into one location, to help
get a handle on what’s out there.</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p><a href="https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc7154.html">BCP 54/RFC 7154</a> is the 
IETF consensus document providing guidelines for IETF
participant conduct.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><a href="https://www7.ietf.org/about/groups/iesg/statements/anti-harassment-policy/">IETF Anti-Harassment Policy</a>.  This is
an IESG statement putting forth an anti-harassment policy.
It may be worth checking to verify that it’s consistent with
both RFC 7154 and RFC 7776, both of which are more recent.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><a href="https://www.ietf.org/about/note-well/">IETF Note Well</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><a href="https://www.ietf.org/about/note-well/">IETF Anti-Harassment Procedures - BCP 25/RFC 7776</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><a href="https://www.ietf.org/archive/id/draft-perkins-irtf-code-of-conduct-00.html">IRTF Code of Conduct</a>.  This document
is currently in draft form and has not yet been published,
but is here for completeness.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><a href="https://www.ietf.org/about/groups/iesg/statements/on-inclusive-language/">IESG Statement on Inclusive Language</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><a href="https://www.ietf.org/about/groups/iesg/statements/internet-draft-authorship/">IESG Statement on Internet-Draft Authorship</a> covers those cases where someone has been added as an author on a draft without their knowledge or consent.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><a href="https://www.ietf.org/about/groups/iesg/statements/statement-on-oppressive-exclusionary-language/">IESG Statement on Oppressive or Exclusionary Language</a> is not really a 
policy, per se.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><a href="https://www.ietf.org/about/groups/iesg/statements/meeting-photography-policy/">IESG Meeting Photography Policy</a> makes it 
clear that the wishes of those who don’t want to be photographed
must be respected.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><a href="https://www.ietf.org/about/groups/iesg/statements/off-topic-postings/">IESG Advice for WG Chairs Dealing with Off-Topic Posting</a>.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><a href="https://www.ietf.org/about/groups/iesg/statements/disruptive-posting/">IESG Statement on Disruptive Posting</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><a href="https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc7704">An IETF With Much Diversity and Professional Conduct</a>.  This document is
not a BCP, nor is it normative (was it published as an
individual contribution?) but provides some background, as
well as some expectations of IETF participants.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><a href="https://www.ietf.org/about/administration/policies-procedures/code-of-conduct/">IETF LLC Code of Conduct</a> covers
LLC contractors and employees.  It does <em>not</em> cover most IETF
participants (participants, chairs, IESG and IAB members, etc) but is included here for completeness.</p>
